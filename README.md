supermarket-deals-ror
=====================

Giving a go at creating a web application version of my [supermarket deals project](https://github.com/Daniel-ltw/countdown-nz-deals-parser#countdown-nz-deals-parser). 

Current Ruby on Rails version of this implementation is @ [supermarket.technikality.info](http://supermarket.technikality.info). 
Raise an issue in this project, if you found bugs or have suggestions. 

Currently will start this project from scratch. 
Automation in the web application should remove any manual labour needed. 
Few features I could think of right now in comparison to the old project: 
* better sorting
* better searching
* better view & display (mobile and desktop compatibility)

#### Further Plans (after the initial)
* Might be looking into data warehousing product prices from New Zealand supermarkets (would include vast varieties of supermarket). 
* Might also include historical chart regarding product prices, better price trend view for each product.
